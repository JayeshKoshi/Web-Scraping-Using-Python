This code is a Python program that performs web scraping to track the price of a product on a specific URL. It also includes features like sending an email notification when the price decreases and plotting a scatter plot of the price history.

Here's a description of the code:

1. The code begins by importing necessary libraries such as `bs4` for web scraping, `urllib.request` for making HTTP requests, `smtplib` for sending emails, `time` and `datetime` for time-related operations, `csv` for working with CSV files, and `matplotlib.pyplot` for data visualization.

2. The code then imports the `Tkinter` library to create a GUI (Graphical User Interface) for the program.

3. The main window is created using the `Tk()` function, and its properties, such as size, title, and background image, are configured.

4. Various GUI elements like labels, entry fields, and buttons are created using the `Label`, `Entry`, and `Button` classes from `Tkinter`. These elements allow the user to input the URL and desired price, and to initiate the price tracking.

5. The `check_price()` function is defined to scrape the webpage specified by the URL and extract the price of the product. It uses the `urllib.request` library to fetch the webpage's HTML, and `bs4.BeautifulSoup` to parse the HTML and extract the relevant information. If the price is found, it is displayed on the GUI, saved in a CSV file, and compared with the previous price to check for a decrease. If a decrease is detected, an email notification is sent using the `smtplib` library.

6. The `send_email()` function is defined to send an email using the SMTP protocol. It requires a Gmail account for authentication. It takes a message as input and sends it to a specified recipient.

7. The `price_decrease()` function checks if the latest price in the `prices_list` is less than the previous price, indicating a decrease.

8. The `button_clicked()` function is called when the "ENTER" button is clicked. It retrieves the URL from the entry field, checks for its presence, and starts the price tracking process. It repeatedly calls the `check_price()` function, compares prices, sends email notifications if necessary, and sleeps for 2 seconds between iterations.

9. The `plot()` function is defined to plot a scatter plot of the price history stored in the CSV file. It reads the data from the file and uses `matplotlib.pyplot` to create and display the plot.

10. The `prices_list` is defined as an empty list to store the price history.

11. The `top.mainloop()` function is called to start the GUI event loop and keep the program running until the user closes the window.

Overall, this code provides a GUI-based price scraping tool that allows the user to track the price of a product, receive email notifications for price decreases, and visualize the price history.
